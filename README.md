# Personal Portfolio

This is an assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-advanced-html-and-css-personal-portfolio) but I will use it as my portfolio as well. Quite an interesting project, I wanted to do it for a long time, but to start I really needed to have projects for a portfolio :)

What was done:

1. The first animation that greets, which plays once for many minutes so as not to be annoying.
2. Dark and light theme support. The theme is selected depending on the theme of your system or browser.
3. There are many animations to improve the user experience. Animated sections, section with projects, header, etc.
4. Phone screen support. Although it is not worth mentioning, but the work was done.

What i used:

1. Didn't use libraries. Everything was written exclusively with HTML CSS and JS.
2. I think that's all :D

What can be done in the future:

1. Add some more animations.
2. Add a theme switcher.
3. Rethink some sections.
4. Instead of simply specifying contacts, make a form for feedback.

If anyone has any suggestions or advice, or maybe someone will catch bug, I'd be happy to chat on Discord. My Discord Kartoshechka#3776
